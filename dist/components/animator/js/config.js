 * This configuration JavaScript file provides one configuration object that
 * contains map and layers objects that framework uses for OpenLayers. Also,
 * configuration properties may be provided for the animation that wraps
 * multiple animation layers.
 *
 * Notice, instead of instantiating map and layers directly here,
 * they are instantiated later. Then, framework still has possibility to fine tune
 * settings if necessary before instantiation.
 *
 * {fi.fmi.metoclient.ui.animator.Config} configuration object structure is:
 * {
 *     // Map contains options object that defines a map that framework creates.
 *     // Object has {className} property that defines the name of the map class as a string.
 *     // In normal cases this is always "OpenLayers.Map" string. Also, object has {args} array
 *     // as a parameter. This array contains items that are used as parameters for the constructor
 *     // when map instance is created. Usually {args} contains only one options object for the map.
 *     // See {OpenLayers.Map} documentation for map arguments.
 *     map : { className : {String}, args : [ {Object}, ... ] },
 *
 *     // Array of layer configuration objects.
 *     // The structure of layer configuration objects are same as in map object above.
 *     // So, in layers array one layer configuration object contains {className} string parameter
 *     // and {args} array.
 *     // For example, {className} could be "OpenLayers.Layer.WMS" string and {args} array may contain
 *     // string for name, string for URL, params object and options object.
 *     // See {OpenLayers.Layer.WMS} documentation for the arguments object structures.
 *     // Also, {OpenLayers.Layer.WMTS} layers may be used. For animations, see
 *     // {OpenLayers.Layer.Animation} that describes configuration object for animations.
 *     // Animation may use {OpenLayers.Layer.Animation.WMS} or {OpenLayers.Layer.Animation.WMTS}.
 *     // {OpenLayers.Layer.Animation.WMS} contains animation configuration object inside options object.
 *     // {OpenLayers.Layer.Animation.WMTS} contains animation configuration object in the root level of
 *     // the configuration object.
 *     layers : [
 *         { className : {String}, args : [ {String|Object|etc}, ... ] },
